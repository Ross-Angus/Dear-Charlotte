		<h1>Stage fighting</h1>

		<p>Bourne Identity it ain’t. In ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pefR8-up_o8">the Tom Baker years</a>’ double tape<note>Sadly only available on <jargon type="VHS"/> but fortunately I have a video player for such emergencies</note>, he describes Doctor Who fighting as <q>operatic</q>. Somehow, by making the violence more dramatic and less subtle, it is less life-like and less scary for children. Only once does the fourth Doctor have a proper punch up and that’s in a time-lord brain matrix so it’s sort of like a dream so that’s ok then.</p>
		<p>There are lots of terrible stage jaw punches. The Doctor even knocks Sarah Jane out with one. Normally this is friend-breaking behaviour but her brain has been taken over so apparently that’s totally acceptable. As it hypnotising her afterwards. There’s a whole feminist essay in there.</p>

		<p>Mainly, as with <em>Blake’s 7</em>, there’s a lot of wrestling, grappling, throwing and gurning. Often there are regular ‘heavies’ to play extras who cop it. Other times it's the regulars. Tom Baker was famously very enthusiastic about doing his own stunts initially. Then he threw himself into battle with a Sontaran so dramatically he broke his collar bone. You can hear it snap. Brrgh. After that they had to use Terry Walsh with a terrible curly wig that never looked quite as good as Tom Baker’s AWESOME HAIR.</p>
