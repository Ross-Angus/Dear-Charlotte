		<h2>First meeting</h2>
		<p>We first meet Blake in the first episode, <em><a href="/series-1/episode-1-the-way-back/">The Way Back</a></em><note>Well, it <em>is</em> his series, after all.</note>. He's had his memories rubbed out because he used to be a resistance hero. He takes a bit of persuading about his past.</p>
		
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Blake used to be a resistance leader but was caught by <a href="/about-blakes-7/travis/">Travis</a>, who sat in wait for him after receiving information that Blake planned to break some freedom fighters out of jail.</p>

		<h2>Charactor</h2>
		<p>Once Blake begins to recover his memories, he proves an effective leader, who inspires loyalty in (most of) his crew. He's kind of idealistic, hugely stubborn and a <em>bit</em> dull.</p>
		<p>Avon and Blake have an unusual relationship - Blake seems to greatly respect Avon's abilities and honesty. In a funny way they are friends, but Avon would never admit as much.</p>
		<p>Blake is more openly warm to Jenna.</p>
