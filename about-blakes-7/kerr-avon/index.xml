		<ul>
			<li>Takes the piss out of Blake at every opportunity</li>

			<li>Dresses in black</li>
			<li>Takes the piss out of Tarrant at every opportunity</li>
			<li>Perhaps this ought to be just one bullet point</li>

		<p>Avon is part <a href="https://i.imgur.com/tgH1yWk.jpg"><em>Spock</em></a>, part <a href="http://lostinspace.wikia.com/wiki/Doctor_Smith_(Original_Series_Role)"><em>Dr. Zachary Smith</em></a>, part <em>Q</em>, part <em>The Master</em>. He's a man of many parts, basically.</p>
		<p>Usually it's a bad sign when your favourite character on a TV show is the one who turfs up and messes everyone's day up. It suggests that you don't like the main cast that much when some berk pitches up, dumps them in a swamp and then spends the rest of the episode laughing at them, it's your idea of a great time.</p>
		<p>What Avon effortlessly does is pricks the pomposity of characters every chance he gets.</p>
