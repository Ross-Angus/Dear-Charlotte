		<h2>First meeting</h2>
		<p>Blake encounters Vila in the holding cell at the end of <em>The Way Back</em>. Vila is picking Blake's pockets.</p>
		
		<h2>Character development</h2>
		<p>Vila has a few character traits which are similar to <a href="/about-blakes-7/kerr-avon/">Avon</a>: primarily concerned with his own survival, existing on the wrong side of the law and having a high intelligence. However, Vila is much more comfortable in a group than Avon is, and seems to relish the stability of life on <em>The Liberator</em>.</p>
		<p>Even Vila and Avon's names seem to mirror each other, the <q>V</q> like an inverted <q>A</q>, each four letters long.</p>
		<p>From a narrative point of view, Vila's main skill - lock-picking - and his main weakness - cowardice - mean that he is generally required to be in the thick of the action, where he is most uncomfortable. While this isn't ideal for Vila, it's good for drama.</p>
		<p>I quite like Michael Keating's performance. While it can be quite wide, he's not afraid of allowing Vila to be unlikeable.</p>
